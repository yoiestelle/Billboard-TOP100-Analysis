### Part A: Understanding the Data 

This dataset spans from 1940 to 2016 and provides a historical view of the music that has shaped generations.

Key Column Descriptions:

‘week_peak_postion’: highest position the song has reached on the chart up to and including the current week;
‘overall_peak_postion’: the highest position the song has ever achieved on the chart during its entire time since being listed;
‘week_total_week’:  the total number of weeks the song has been on the chart as of the current week.;
‘overall_total_weeks’: the cumulative total number of weeks the song has ever been on the chart.

Remarkably, Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" has achieved a record for longevity by remaining an astounding 85 weeks on the charts. As of the latest data point, on the chart dated January 2, 2016, Adele's "Hello" holds the top spot, followed by Justin Bieber's "Sorry".

### The Evolution of Hip Hop

Introduction: This analysis explores the presence of six pivotal hip hop artists—Drake, JAY-Z, Kanye West, 50 Cent, Ying Yang Twins, and Travis Scott—on the Billboard charts to gauge their popularity, influence, and career longevity.


#### Visualization 1: 
By analyzing the total number of times each artist appears on the chart, which represents their presence in the Billboard Top 100, we can examine their popularity.

#### Data Analysis:
The initial visualization illustrates Drake's exceptional presence in the Billboard Top 100, surpassing 300 chart entries, which notably eclipses his contemporaries. Following Drake are JAY-Z and Kanye West, who also boast significant numbers of chart appearances.

The first line graphs detailing cumulative chart appearances delineate Drake's meteoric rise and sustained influence in the music industry. JAY-Z's trajectory reveals a pioneer who made his mark on the Top 100 earlier than his peers, although his visibility tapered off around 2010, hinting at a transition in his career or musical direction.

In the faceted line graphs, Kanye West's graph reveals a compelling narrative of highs and lows, with fluctuations that map onto his album releases and public persona shifts, which shows not just longevity but a dynamic interaction with the music scene.
Based on the bubble chart, Ying Yang Twins display a more modest footprint in the Top 100, which suggests a more condensed period of peak activity compared to the other featured artists, excluding Travis Scott, who emerged on the scene considerably later, as he appears till late 2015.
